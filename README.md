# Missing-Star-Problem-Generator
Missing Star Problem &amp; Adding Star Problem Generator. This code is written in python.

-----
\[Setting Parameters\]

mag_lim = 6 # limit of apparent magnitude
missing_cnt = 5 # the number of missing stars
missing_lim = 2.5 # the limit of apparent magnitude of missing stars
mode = 1 # (1/2) way of projection (mode 1 has less distortion around horizon)
adding_cnt = 0 # the number of adding stars
adding_inf = -2 # the lower bound of apparent magnitude of adding stars
adding_sup = 2 # the upper bound of apparent magnitude of adding stars
low_a = 10 # the lower bound of altitude of missing/adding star (unit of degree)
map_num = 5 # the number of starmaps
lat_inf = -90 # the lower bound of latitude of observer
lat_sup = 90 # the upper bound of latitude of observer
